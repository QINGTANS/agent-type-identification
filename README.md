# agent-type-identification-algorithms-with-experiment
In this package, it includes the whole Agent Miner approach and four agent-type identification techniques (AM, BME, AMatrix, CWM). We created the pipeline that combine the agent-type identification techniques and the Agent system mining technique. Here are some points related to how to utilize this package:

## How to select the agent type identification techniques and set the thresholds?
There are multiple parameter triplets, and all the identification techniques and the thresholds can be set in the `agent_miner_main.py`:
1. the AM algorithm parameter, 


## How to run the experiment?

## What are the outputs of the experiment?
